Bioinformatics is an evolving field of study involving the use of computational tools and statistics to collect, analyse, visualize, store and disseminate biological information and data, i.e., nucleic acid sequences and amino acid sequences or their annotations. This field is related to the main ‘omics’ in biology, such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics.

**Introduction to Bioinformatics:**

Bioinformatics has aided in the analysis of large data sets of biological data and answer questions in a shorter time than before. The groundwork of bioinformatics was laid down by Claude Shannon and Alan Turing in 1940s and the term “bioinformatics” was coined by Dutch theoretical biologist, Paulien Hogeweg (Hogeweg, 2011). The field was propelled by the race to conclude the Human Genome Project in 1980s – 2000s (Rothberg et al., 2012). Current trends, see its utilization in clinical and drug discovery settings to produce more biological data on human diseases and how to treat, cure, and/or prevent them. The main coding languages employed in bioinformatics are Python, R, and Bash. I will focus on R language, specifically the tool, RStudio.

RStudio is an application that can be used for R and Python, and it consists of tools that can create and deploy R packages for use in bioinformatics and provides panels/consoles that enable you to visualize your code in real time. This has been exceedingly helpful for newcomers transitioning into bioinformatics employing the R language. For biological data to be understood and translated to a simpler language for public dissemination and utilization. Visualization of biological data with the use of R and RStudio makes it simple to do plotting and advanced functions without needing numerous blocks of code or prior background in programming languages due to the numerous R packages of use in bioinformatics.

Data visualization plays a vital role in bioinformatics, helping researchers to make sense of complex datasets, recognize patterns, and effectively share their results. In cancer research, where large-scale genomic, proteomic, or clinical data is frequently analyzed, clear presentation of information is crucial. By converting raw data into visual formats, scientists can uncover relationships, trends, and outliers that may not be apparent in traditional tabular data. An example of a commonly used RStudio package is ggplot. ggplot is an R package that deploys statistical and graphical means, that allow one to create novel graphs that are tailored to your specific situation. It allows for a variety of graphs such as scatterplots, bar graphs, histogram, bar plots, etc to be created as demonstrated below (Wickham, 2009).

Figure 1:For example: ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom\_histogram() will create a histogram

**Conclusion:**

Cancer research has greatly benefited from bioinformatics as it consists of massive data sets that include gene expression profiles, mutations, epigenetic changes, protein expression profiles, patient medical histories, imaging data, pathway analysis, etc. By visualizing this data, scientists can identify biomarkers of cancer, understand the pathways involved in the cancer, and assess possible drug molecules that could aid in treatment(Banwait & Bastola, 2015), (Fu et al., 2020),(Anashkina et al., 2021).
