The article presents TBtools, a flexible bioinformatics tool created to assist biologists in the analysis of huge biological datasets, particularly those produced by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology. Since most bioinformatics tools need significant programming abilities, many wet-lab researchers are facing difficulties analyzing data in the context of big-data biology. This issue is addressed by TBtools, as it provides a user-friendly, straightforward platform that combines a variety of tools and features, allowing biologists to do advanced studies without requiring the usage of command-line interfaces.

More than 130 functions are included in TBtools, which cover a broad range of bioinformatics operations such as format conversion, data visualization, and sequence management. Bulk sequence extraction, gene structure visualization, and the production of complex graphical representations such as heatmaps and Circos plots are among the functions it offers. Because the toolkit is based on the Java Runtime Environment, it may be used with Windows, Mac, and Linux, three of the main operating systems. Because of its cross-platform compatibility, researchers can use the tool on any system of their choice. The interactive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) of TBtools, which makes data analysis easier for users, is one of its main advantages. Real-time graph editing is made possible by the software's unique plotting engine, JIGplot, which lets users adjust visual components including color, shape, and labels with a few mouse clicks. This capability ensures that researchers may rapidly and effectively produce images that are ready for publication.

Apart from its graphical user interface, TBtools incorporates numerous popular bioinformatics tools, such as BLAST, MEME, and IQ-TREE, enabling users to carry out phylogenetic analysis, motif discovery, and sequence alignment without requiring multiple different programs. With rapid visualization choices for displaying results, the toolkit also makes enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway data easier. With more than 15,000 active users, TBtools has been positively accepted by the biological research community. The software's functionality and user experience have been enhanced through the feedback from this user base, ensuring that it continues to suit the evolving demands of biologists. In conclusion, TBtools distinguishes itself as a thorough, user-friendly toolkit that integrates experimental biology with bioinformatics to facilitate the effective study of large biological data.
